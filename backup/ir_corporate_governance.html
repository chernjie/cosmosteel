<h2><strong class="this_red">Corporate Governance</strong></h2><br />
                    
                    <p>Our Directors recognise the importance of good corporate governance and the offering of high standards of accountability to our Shareholders. To this end, our Board of Directors has established the following three committees: (i) the Audit Committee; (ii) the Remuneration Committee; and (iii) the Nominating Committee.</p>

<p>In addition, Mr Low Beng Tin, Ms Geraldine Ong Siew Ting, Mr Jovenal R. Santiago and Ms Tan Siok Chin have been appointed as our Independent Directors. Our Directors consider them to be independent as they do not have, any existing business or professional relationship with our Group, our Directors or Substantial Shareholders. They are also not related to any of our Directors or Substantial Shareholders.</p>

                    
 <h3><strong class="this_red">Audit Committee</strong></h3>

<p>Our Audit Committee comprises Mr Jovenal R. Santiago, Ms Geraldine Ong Siew Ting and Ms Tan Siok Chin. The Chairman of our Audit Committee is Mr Jovenal R. Santiago. Our Audit Committee will meet periodically to perform, inter alia, the following functions:</p>

<div class="list_let">
<ul>
<li>review the audit plans of our external auditors;</li>

<li>review the external auditors' reports;</li>

<li>review the co-operation given by our Company's officers to the external auditors;</li>

<li>review the financial statements of our Company and our Group before submission to our Board;</li>

<li>review the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and nominate external auditors for re-appointment and approving the remuneration and terms of engagement of external auditors;</li>

<li>review and rectify all interested person transactions, if any, to ensure that they comply with the approved internal control procedures and have been conducted on an arm's length basis; and</li>

<li>generally, perform such other functions and duties as may be required by the relevant laws or provisions of the Listing Manual of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (as may be amended from time to time).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Apart from the above functions, our Audit Committee will commission and review the findings of internal investigations into matters where there is suspicion of fraud or irregularity, failure of internal controls or infringement of any law, rule or regulation which has or is likely to have a material impact on our operating results and/or financial position. 
In the event that a member of our Audit Committee is interested in any matter being considered by our Audit Committee, he will abstain from reviewing that particular transaction or voting on that particular resolution.</p>


 <h3><strong class="this_red">Remuneration Committee</strong></h3>

<p>Our Remuneration Committee comprises Ms Geraldine Ong Siew Ting, Mr Jovenal R. Santiago and Ms Tan Siok Chin. The Chairman of our Remuneration Committee is Ms Geraldine Ong Siew Ting. Our Remuneration Committee oversees executive remuneration and development in our Company with the goal of building capable and committed management teams.</p>

<p>Our Remuneration Committee is governed by written terms of reference under which it is responsible for:</p>

<div class="list_let">
<ul>
<li>reviewing annually the remuneration of each of the Directors and key executives and making recommendations to the Board; and</li>

<li>recommending to the Board a framework of remuneration for the Directors and key executives.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<p>In setting the remuneration framework, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the performance of the Group as well as the Directors and key executives. As part of its review, the Remuneration Committee ensures that the remuneration packages are comparable within the industry and that the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and controlling shareholders of the Group and employees who are related to such persons are in line with the Group’s staff remuneration guidelines and commensurate with their respective job scopes and level of responsibilities. Any bonuses, pay increases and/or promotions for any employees who are related to the Directors and substantial shareholders will also be subject to the review and approval of the Remuneration Committee. If required, the Remuneration Committee will seek expert professional advice. The recommendations of our Remuneration Committee will be submitted for endorsement by our entire Board. All aspects of remuneration, including but not limited to Directors' fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options and benefits-in-kind shall be reviewed by our Remuneration Committee.</p>

<p>Each member of our Remuneration Committee will abstain from reviewing and approving his own remuneration and the remuneration packages of persons related to him. Our Company will disclose in our annual report the total remuneration paid to our Directors and top executives.</p>


<h3><strong class="this_red">Nominating Committee</strong></h3>

<p>Our Nominating Committee comprises Ms Tan Siok Chin, Ms Geraldine Ong Siew Ting and Mr Jovenal R. Santiago. The Chairman of our Nominating Committee is Ms Tan Siok Chin.</p>

<p>Our Nominating Committee is governed by written terms of reference under which it is responsible for:</p>

<div class="list_let">
<ul>
<li>making recommendations to the Board on all board appointments, including re-nomination of Directors, having regard to each Director’s contribution and performance. All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-nomination and re-election at least once every three years;</li>

<li>determining annually whether or not a Director is independent;</li> 

<li>deciding whether or not a Director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his duties as a Director; </li>

<li>deciding on how the Board’s performance may be evaluated and to propose objective criteria for evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness and performance of the Board as a whole and for evaluation and assessment of the contribution by each individual Director to the effectiveness of the Board; and</li>

<li>reviewing any new employment of employees related to the Directors and substantial shareholders and the proposed terms of their employment.</li> 
</ul>
</div>

<p>The Board has implemented performance criteria and process recommended by the Nominating Committee for evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness and performance of the Board as a whole and for evaluation and assessment of the contribution by each individual Director. Each member of the Nominating Committee will abstain from voting on any resolution in respect of the assessment of his performance or re-nomination as Director. </p>

<p>The Nominating Committee has decided that, given the current size of the Board, the background, experience and expertise of each Director and their general participation in Board and Committee Meetings and matters arising, it would not be necessary to evaluate the individual performance of each Director. However, the Nominating Committee has evaluated the performance of the Board as a whole. The performance criteria which the Nominating Committee has used include the Board’s ability to discharge their duties in terms of timeliness and effective communications with third parties such as shareholders and the regulatory authorities and each individual Director’s commitment of time to attending Board and Committee meetings and the discharge of his duties in relation to the affairs of the Group.</p>
