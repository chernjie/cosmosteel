                    	<p>Service excellence is always a top priority for CosmoSteel Group, and to this end, we offer a range of complementary and value-added services to our customers. </p>

<p>We provide product customisation services  through our fabrication capabilities and are able to modify the size and thread dimensions of our products to meet specific engineering and fabrication designs of our customers. </p>

<p>To ensure quality assurance, we provide validation and testing services as well. Our range of Non-Destructive Testing includes alloy verification, dye penetrant testing, magnetic particle testing, UT testing for lamination and longitudinal or transverse defects, wall thickness check and ferrite content check amongst others. We also provide third party testing and inspection for materials that require Hydrogen Induction Cracking or Sulfide Stress Cracking.</p>

<p>We also provide expedited delivery services for material grades that are difficult to source with an international network of suppliers with whom we have strategic alliances from years of partnership and cooperation.</p>

<p>Over and above all these, CosmoSteel Group offers project management services to our customers, an additional set of value-add services that propels our service excellence to the next level. As part of this suite of services, we are able to provide procurement and expediting services for the specific materials required by our customers as well as inventory management services to customers without warehouse or storage facilities. Our project management services also includes just-in-time delivery according to our customersâ€™ requirements and logistics arrangements for expedited deliveries, both of which yield significant time and storage cost savings for our customers.</p>
